# traffic-study
Project with Prof. Sowers studying the traffic data of NYC taxis, provided by Prof. Work.

Project partner: Derrek Yager.

Institute name: University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Department of Mathematics.

Work commenced May 2016.

\_\_main__.py is to be treated as the "work file" of this project. It is the only file which should be run on its own.
All other files are designed as modules which can be called into \_\_main__.py using import.

###Order in which the codes should be run:
1. Link\_data_extraction.py (extracts from database, lines corresponding to specific link)
2. Data_matrix.py (all the key functions relating to the data matrix)
3. Traveltimes\_and\_trips_extraction.py
4. Periodicity_analysis.py
5. Autocorrelation.py
6. Daily_trends.py
7. Non\_negative\_matrix_factorization.py

**Following are standalone codes that have not been linked to the problem yet, but will come in handy later. Consequently, I am yet to add comments to these file and/or clean up their code.**
1. Low\_rank_approximation.py
2. Principal\_component_analysis.py

All data files are now in a seperate folder.

**Also, refer to .pdf report for details of the why?'s and how?'s.**
