# traffic-study
Project with Prof. Sowers studying the traffic data of NYC taxis, provided by Prof. Work.

Work commenced May 2016.

Order in which the codes should be run:
1. Link_data_extraction.py
2. Traveltimes_and_trips.py
3. Periodicity_analysis.py

The code of Matrix_derivative_integrate.py is a standalone code that has not been linked to the problem yet, but will come in handy once we start doing low-rank approximations of the data. Consequently, I am yet to add comments to this file and/or clean up its code.

Also, refer to .pdf report for details of the why?'s and how?'s.
